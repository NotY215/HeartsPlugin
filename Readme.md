## 🆕 Recent Updates

### ✔ Bedrock Action Bar Support

Bedrock players (Floodgate) now receive heart bars through action bar since they can’t see floating text properly.

### ✔ Custom Death Messages

Now the plugin shows:

* Who killed the player (mob/player)
* Exact reason of death (fall, lava, fire, explosion, etc.)
* Remaining health display like: `💔 11.2/20.0`

Example:

```
Player Pro215 was slain by Zombie 💔 11.2/20.0
```

### ✔ Floodgate + Geyser Safe Integration

No crashes if Floodgate is not installed. Bedrock detection is safe.

### ✔ Improved Floating Heart System

* Auto-spawning invisible armor stands
* Smooth updates every 10 ticks
* Works for all mobs + players

### ✔ Vault Economy Enhancements

Shows balance below heart bar for Java players.

### ✔ Fully Compatible with Paper 1.21+

No deprecated API. Attribute system updated.
